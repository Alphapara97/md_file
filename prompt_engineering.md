# Prompt Engineering – ELI5 (Explain Like I’m 5)

Prompt engineering is all about crafting clear, specific instructions or questions that you feed to an AI system. Think of it like giving directions to a friend: if you say “Let’s meet at the store,” your friend might ask, “Which store?” or “What time?” Similarly, AI models need good prompts so they can produce helpful responses.

## Why Is Prompt Engineering Important?
- **Clarity:** A clear prompt gives the AI a precise direction. 
- **Context:** The more relevant information you give, the more accurate your answer.
- **Creativity:** You can tailor prompts for various tasks—brainstorming, summarizing, or even storytelling.

## Example of a Basic Prompt
If you’re planning a day out in San Francisco and you want AI to help, you might start with something simple:

Generate a list of hikes near SF.


This prompt is direct and should yield a handful of hiking options within the San Francisco area. But maybe you have specific requirements, such as the length of your hike. Here’s a more refined prompt:

Generate a list of hikes near SF that take 2 hours to complete.



By adding the detail about time (2 hours), the AI knows to filter out hikes that take significantly longer or shorter. This is what **prompt engineering** is all about—giving enough context so that the AI can zero in on the best possible response for your needs.

## The Anatomy of an “01 Prompt”
Greg Brockman (one of the co-founders of OpenAI) tweeted about “The Anatomy of an 01 Prompt,” illustrating how to craft instructions effectively. Here’s an **ELI5** version of what that means:

1. **“0” Stage: Provide the context**  
   In this stage, you give the AI all the background information it needs. For our hiking example, that might mean mentioning your location (San Francisco) and constraints (hikes must be around 2 hours).

2. **“1” Stage: Specify the outcome or task**  
   This is where you directly state what you want the AI to do: “Generate a list of hikes...” or “Summarize these text snippets…,” etc.

Combining both stages (the “0” and the “1”) gives you a prompt that is both **rich in context** and **clear on the objective**. For example:
